# Modal Emacs #

There are a bunch of frameworks that emulate Vim keybindings in
Emacs. This is not one of them.

I used Vim for years, and I really liked it. I switched to Emacs, but
that is besides the point. However, Emacs and Vim are very different
beasts, and the way that they operate is also very different. Thus, it
makes sense to.

personally, i have developed some RSI and this makes all of this more
pressing. 

# installation #

Don't know yet. Add the .el file to your loadpath and require it. 

clearly this should be a package. 

Im guessing that what will need to go here is some kind of
instructions on enabling/disabling on a per-mode basis.
