Trying out developer "lab notebook" idea



* <2013-04-07 Sun>  
** code cleanup/regrouping
*** adding tests -- doing pseudo tdd
*** began integrating eieio as object system
** added a ton of tests
*** testing out a new style of writing emacs tests
**** a macro `modal-test` which handles defining a test in modal-emacs style
**** tests can be run immediately if a flag is set (thus easy to eval flags)
**** a single wrapping sexp per test
